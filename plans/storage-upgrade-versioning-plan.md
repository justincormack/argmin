# Storage Upgrade And Versioning Plan

Status: draft

## Context

The project currently does **not** support upgrades from older on-disk formats or older
wire/control-plane snapshots. That is intentional while Phase 11 stabilisation and Phase
12 Raft work are still churning core metadata, control-plane, route-map, and command-log
structures. Until that churn settles, compatibility code for old formats makes the current
baseline harder to reason about and can make APIs worse by carrying optional or fallback
states that are not truly optional.

The recent nullable multipart initiator cleanup is the example to avoid: a field that was
kept nullable for a migration we do not currently support leaked into production caller
semantics and made the baseline more complex. The near-term rule should remain simple:
current code opens only current-format state, and any old/unknown format fails closed.

This plan defines how to move from that rule to deliberate versioned upgrade support later.
It also moves the former Phase 11 Slice 2 trigger-SQL-body work here: stale trigger
definitions are an upgrade correctness problem, not a current stabilisation task, because
there should not be any supported legacy triggers yet.

Topology resize is tracked separately in `storage-topology-resize-plan.md`. Some durable
format/version decisions will be prerequisites for resize, but resize also changes live
placement semantics and needs its own topology-generation design.

## Current Policy

- No migration compatibility is required for existing deployments.
- Old, missing, or unsupported format versions should fail closed rather than be repaired or
  silently interpreted.
- Do not add fallback parsing or nullable fields for hypothetical legacy data during the
  current pre-alpha phase.
- When a structure changes now, update the baseline format and tests directly.

## Goals

1. Remove legacy compatibility paths that are already present but not required.
2. Identify every durable or cross-process format that will need explicit versioning.
3. Add clear baseline current-version markers to those formats.
4. Define the future upgrade framework, including trigger-body correctness, but do not
   implement upgrade-from-old-format behavior until after Phase 12 Raft structure churn has
   settled.

## Non-Goals For Now

- Supporting any existing pre-alpha store in production.
- Opening older SQLite schemas and migrating them in place.
- Carrying mixed-version clusters.
- Maintaining old RPC/control-plane encodings beyond explicit current-version rejection
  tests.

## Phase 0: Legacy Compatibility Audit And Removal

Audit the codebase for compatibility paths that were added speculatively or for earlier
scratch formats. Remove them unless they are needed for the current format.

Known audit targets:

- Nullable or fallback data fields that should be mandatory in the current schema.
  - The multipart initiator identity cleanup removed one such class. Use it as the model:
    make caller semantics explicit, require the field at construction/storage/RPC
    boundaries, and reject absent data instead of filling it later.
- Control-plane state parsing that still accepts version ranges or has per-version branches.
  - The control-plane snapshot parser now rejects non-current versions and requires
    current-format fields such as `max_committed_timestamp_ms`. Keep tests on
    current-format fixtures plus unsupported-version rejection cases, not retained
    old-version parsers.
- Open-time cleanup that mutates state to compensate for older layouts.
  - Current startup/recovery repair should be for crash leftovers in the current format, not
    schema migration.
- Any `Option<T>` in durable records, RPC payloads, or command payloads where the value is
  always required for the current format and `None` exists only for legacy compatibility.

Exit criteria:

- A grep/audit document lists every removed legacy path and every current-format recovery
  path that might superficially look like migration code.
- Current-format recovery paths must explain why they are crash recovery rather than
  legacy-version compatibility.
- New code review rule: no speculative migration fallback while upgrades are unsupported.

PG SQLite baseline completed 2026-07-27:

- The PG database now records one current `PRAGMA user_version` as part of
  transactional schema creation. Version zero is accepted only for a database
  with no user schema objects; existing unversioned and differently versioned
  databases fail closed.
- All speculative `ALTER TABLE` migrations and data backfills were removed.
  Current columns, indexes, constraints, and triggers are created directly as
  the baseline schema.
- Metadata-digest bootstrap has a current-format incomplete marker created with
  the schema. Missing markers, digest rows, or triggers on a completed store are
  corruption and fail closed rather than being treated as an older store.
- The unused bucket-subresource discriminants 2 and 3 were removed from the SQL
  constraint, matching the current typed writer and decoder exactly.

This completes the PG SQLite portion of Phase 0 and its baseline version marker;
the other durable and cross-process boundaries in Phase 1 remain separate audit
work.

## Phase 1: Version Boundary Inventory

Document every durable or cross-process format that needs an explicit baseline version.

Initial inventory:

- PG SQLite store schema.
- Metadata digest trigger definitions and the `metadata_table_digests` cached rows.
- Metadata command log payload encoding and command checksum semantics.
- Metadata command checkpoint encoding.
- Canonical metadata state digest encoding.
- Pending metadata command slots and scoped provenance fields.
- Bucket/object/stream/multipart durable rows whose shape participates in command-log
  replay or recovery.
- Object payload/shard storage metadata, including storage-byte and payload-byte integrity
  fields.
- Reclaim/finalizer/repair/backfill durable queues and claim rows.
- Control-plane authority state file.
- Control-plane command and snapshot frames.
- Storage-node RPC frame and per-kind payload encodings.
- Any future Raft log entry, snapshot, membership, and application-state encodings.
- Production-facing or persisted diagnostics if operators or tooling are expected to consume
  them across binary versions.
- Test-only local debug/diagnostic endpoints do not need versioning: tests that consume them
  are tied to the fixed version of the code under test, and their shape can change with the
  test harness.

For each boundary, record:

- owner module
- current version marker location
- whether old versions are rejected, silently accepted, or partially parsed
- whether the format can be upgraded in place, must be rebuilt from another authority, or
  must be treated as incompatible
- tests that prove unsupported versions fail closed

## Phase 2: Baseline Version Markers

After the inventory, ensure each format has a single explicit current baseline version.

Rules:

- Current-version constants should be named and local to the format owner.
- Parser/open paths should reject missing or unsupported versions with typed errors.
- Current-format construction should always write the current version.
- If a format is self-describing by magic plus version, malformed/unknown magic and unknown
  version should have separate tests.
- If a format is SQLite-backed, use a dedicated metadata table or `PRAGMA user_version`
  consistently; do not infer schema version from incidental table/column presence alone.

This phase still does not implement upgrade steps. It only creates a clean baseline that a
later upgrade framework can reason about.

## Phase 3: Future Upgrade Framework

Implement this only after Phase 12 Raft structure churn is stable enough that upgrade tests
will not be rewritten continuously.

Upgrade framework requirements:

- A store opens by reading the format version before serving or repairing state.
- Upgrade steps are explicit, ordered, idempotent where possible, and crash-safe.
- Each step has preconditions, postconditions, and a verification scan.
- Upgrade code must not reuse normal crash-recovery cleanup as an implicit migration.
- A failed upgrade leaves the store closed and diagnosable.
- Mixed-version cluster behavior must be defined before any rolling upgrade support:
  either unsupported with a hard version gate, or supported through explicit compatibility
  windows and Raft/control-plane feature negotiation.

Testing requirements:

- Golden stores/snapshots for every supported old version.
- Crash injection between every upgrade step and its version bump.
- Reopen-after-crash property tests that prove idempotence or fail-closed behavior.
- Differential tests that compare upgraded state against a fresh current-format store built
  from equivalent logical operations.
- Unsupported-too-old and unsupported-too-new tests for every versioned boundary.

## Phase 4: Trigger SQL Body Verification

This is the former Phase 11 Slice 2. It belongs here because stale trigger definitions arise
when a store created under an older schema is opened by newer code.

Current `metadata_digest_triggers_complete` only checks that trigger names exist in
`sqlite_master`. Under real upgrade support, that is insufficient: an old trigger with the
same name but different SQL could keep updating cached table digests using an obsolete row
digest expression.

Upgrade-time behavior should be:

1. Store the expected trigger SQL hash or schema-generation tag for every digest-tracked
   table.
2. On open, compare the stored/current expected trigger identity with the installed trigger
   SQL.
3. If the store version says the trigger body is from an older supported generation, run the
   explicit upgrade step: drop and recreate the triggers, then force a full materialised
   table-digest recompute before serving.
4. If the trigger body is unknown, malformed, or inconsistent with the declared version,
   fail closed rather than repairing silently.
5. Keep the Slice 1 materialised digest scan as corruption detection; do not treat it as the
   trigger upgrade mechanism.

Trigger upgrade tests:

- Open a golden old-version store with old trigger SQL and verify the upgrade recreates the
  trigger bodies and refreshes cached digests.
- Inject a crash after trigger recreation but before digest recompute and verify reopen
  resumes or fails closed according to the step contract.
- Corrupt only the trigger SQL identity while leaving materialised rows valid and verify the
  store does not serve until the mismatch is resolved through a supported upgrade path.
- Corrupt materialised rows or state digest and verify upgrade does not mask real
  corruption.

## Phase 5: Rolling Upgrade And Raft Interaction

This phase should wait until the Phase 12 replicated control plane has a stable log/snapshot
shape.

Requirements and open questions:

- Storage nodes and frontends must eventually support different binary versions during a
  node-by-node cluster upgrade. The design may impose a bounded compatibility window, but it
  cannot require all frontends and storage nodes to restart atomically on the same binary.
- Define the supported version skew range and feature-gate rules for frontend-to-storage,
  storage-node-to-control-plane, and control-plane/Raft interactions.
- Does Raft log replay require old command decoders forever, or can upgrades require
  checkpoint/snapshot compaction first?
- How are feature gates represented in the control plane?
- Can metadata PG schema upgrades happen independently per PG, or must the whole cluster be
  quiesced?
- How does rolling binary upgrade interact with topology resize? See
  `storage-topology-resize-plan.md`; a cluster should not run resize operations across
  binaries that disagree on placement-generation semantics.
- What is the rollback story after a node has written a newer format?

Until these are answered, do not add rolling-upgrade compatibility code.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Remove the trigger-verification item from Phase 11 stabilisation tracking and keep this
   plan as the upgrade home for it.
2. Audit existing version/fallback code and remove unsupported legacy compatibility where it
   worsens current invariants.
3. Add or tighten current-version rejection tests for existing versioned formats.
4. Defer trigger body hashing/recreation until the upgrade framework is deliberately
   started.
